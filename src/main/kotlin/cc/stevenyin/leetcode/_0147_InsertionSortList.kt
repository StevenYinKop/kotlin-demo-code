/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/insertion-sort-list/
 * Given the head of a singly linked list, sort the list using insertion sort, and return the sorted list's head.
 *
 * The steps of the insertion sort algorithm:
 *
 * Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
 * At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.
 * It repeats until no input elements remain.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
 * Output: [1,2,3,4]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
 * Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5000].
 * -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 *
